# A&J's State Machine UI
for comparing changes in code

This repo has the code more or less how it is at the end of the video. I don't recommend looking at this code until you watch the video. It'll explain everything.

Still figuring things out as I go, but I think this should make things a lot more clear now! And accessible!

### Next steps
I think you should focus on:
    - creating a fontAwesome kit for your shapes (though I think they're all in the one you have imported)
    - creating different shapes (triangle, dumbbell/line) using fontAwesome.
    - using strings and if statements to create different shapes using the `rect()` method.
    - clicking and dragging to create a line, and exploring detection (using methods similar to `over()` to "select" a target frot he connecting line)
    
Once these are together, then we can start thinking about the "backend"--namely, making function placeholders for control of sensors and/or motors.
